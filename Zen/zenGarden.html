    <h2 class="walk">Fainting Goats</h2>
    <p>A desciption taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fainting_goat" class="sprint">Wikipedia...</a></p>
    <p>A myotonic goat, otherwise known as the fainting goat, is a domestic goat whose muscles freeze for roughly 10 seconds when the goat feels panic. Though painless, this generally results in the animal collapsing on its side. The characteristic is caused by a hereditary genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or lean against something when startled, and often they continue to run about in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.</p>
	<p>Some fun YouTube videos of fainting goats:</p>

    <h2 class="walk">Mimic Octopus</h2>
    <p>Imagine an octopus that can change its form into fifteen different species. Well, no need to just imagine it! <a class="sprint" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8oQBYw6xxc">Watch the amazing Indonesian Mimic Octopus</a> change itself into tons of creatures. There are reasons to call this animal &quot;awesome&quot;:</p>
    <ol class="rest">
    	<li>It can change itself into a lionfish. Do you even know what a lionfish is? Well, even if you do, I bet you can't change yourself into one.</li>
        <li>It has 8 legs. You have 2. You know you're jealous.</li>
        <li>Oh, I wish I could do that!</li>

        	<td>HTML 2.0 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force HTML Working Group in 1996.</td>
            <td>HTML 3.2 became a W3C Recommendation 14. January 1997. HTML 3.2 added new features such as fonts, tables, applets, superscripts, subscripts and more, to the existing HTML 2.0 standard.</td>
            <td>HTML 4.0 became a W3C Recommendation 18. December 1997. A second release was issued on 24. April 1998 with only some editorial corrections.</td>
            <td>HTML 4.01 became a W3C Recommendation 24. December 1999. It was a minor update of corrections and bug-fixes from HTML 4.0.</td>
            <td>XHTML 1.0 reformulates HTML 4.01 in XML. It became a W3C Recommendation 20. January 2000.</td>
            <td><p>HTML 5 improves interoperability, and reduces development costs, by making precise rules on how to handle all HTML elements, and how to recover from errors.</p>
            <p>Some of the new features in HTML 5 are functions for embedding audio, video, graphics, client-side data storage, and interactive documents.</p>
            <p>On January 22nd, 2008, W3C published a working draft for HTML 5.</p></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="leap">In other words, HTML5 is newest in the world of HTML. It's best to start using it now than have to learn it later.</p>
    
    <h1 id="push">Why can't we use height and width attributes on img tags?</h1>
    <h2 class="run">Because your teacher said so.</h2>
    <h3 class="jog">Because she's a great teacher.</h3>
    <h4 class="jog">Because she knows what she's talking about.</h4>
    <h5 class="jog">Because she's actually done this stuff.</h5>
    <h6 class="jog">Oh, and I guess there is a real reason...</h6>
    <p id="slow">Height and width attributes either make your image pixelated, or don't help with your page load time (if it's a large image in the memory).</p>
